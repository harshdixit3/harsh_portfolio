          <p>
            Hi there! I’m Harsh Dixit, a passionate Java full-stack developer
            based in Jabalpur. With a background in AWS cloud services and a
            penchant for elegant code, I thrive on turning complex problems into
            elegant solutions. Whether it’s building robust APIs, optimizing
            database queries, or creating seamless user experiences, I’m all
            about making technology work seamlessly. When I’m not immersed in
            code, you’ll find me exploring the latest tech trends, sipping
            coffee, and occasionally indulging in a Gameing and Clicking
            Photographs.
